                        Karnataka Table Tennis Association (KTTA) was
                        established more than fifty years ago for the promotion
                        of Table Tennis in Karnataka. The State Association has
                        to its credit organised, a number of National events
                        right from the year, 1969, when the National
                        championship was held and from then on, many National
                        events have been held in Karnataka. In the past, Junior
                        Nationals in 2001, Mayor's Cup in 2003, South Zone
                        National Ranking Tournament in 2004, Inter Institutional
                        Championship in 2005 and in 2016, and National Ranking
                        Championship (South Zone) in 2010, 2012 and in 2017 were
                        conducted successfully. Karnataka has produced several
                        great players (including arjuna awardees) in Table
                        Tennis who have been national champions and have played
                        in international meets. <br /> KTTA is now making good progress
                        in promoting the game with renewed vigour, largely due
                        to the committed members. The Association is headed by
                        Sri Dinesh Gundurao, Member of the Legislative Assembly
                        of Karnataka as President. The Association believes it
                        has much to contribute to the game of Table Tennis in
                        the years to come. <br /> In the past, tournaments and
                        championships organised by KTTA have been amply
                        supported by the Public Sector giants Indian Oil
                        Corporation Ltd. and leading financial Institutions of
                        the country like State Bank of India and Canara Bank,
                        among other organisations in the Public Sector and in
                        the Private Sector. <br /> KTTA enjoys active support by the
                        affiliated District Table Tennis Associations in its
                        endeavour to promote the game. <br />It is the express
                        commitment of KTTA to explore ways and means to
                        recognise talented young boys and girls at the grass
                        root level in the State and promote their growth to
                        become competitive players at the national and
                        international level in the years to come.
